these programs are made to convert POLAR coordinates (degrees) to RECTANGULAR coordinates and VICE-VERSA

these two files do the same things but run in different manners:

conv.py
  runs in a loop with a menu of choice

con2
  is a one-time script that requires arguments
  use "conv2 help" to print an help screen
