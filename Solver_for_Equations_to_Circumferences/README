this little program runs in a loop with a menu to choose what to do


it can resolve equations to circumference in two ways:

- RETURN THE EQUATION GIVEN THE CENTER COORDINATES AND THE RADIUS

- RETURN THE CENTER COORDINATES AND THE RADIUS GIVEN THE EQUATION (the equation must be already solved to have x² and y² having value of 1 and being positive)
